# Entry 1

I recently came to the topic of hematology, the study of blood, when searching up "immunology" in the "people also search for" option in google. I went in-depth and research it as most of the blood diseases are caused by either genetically/ inherited, exposure to radiation, people that are over 50 years old, and even by other diseases. (https://www.hematology.org/Patients/Blood-Disorders.aspx) This was brought to my attention as it helps me remember the time where my 8th-grade science teacher talked about how DNA can be messed up and cause mutations. She said that mutations are rarely beneficial as some could become a nuisance. She uses hemophilia as an example of how a mutation in DNA can be a problem even until now. 

I wish to raise awareness towards diseases, blood specifically since I already had some prior knowledge about one of the blood diseases through the creation of a website using HTML/CSS. This website could be used by people of any age and is interested in learning more about blood disease. I have a website design in mind where there'll be interactive blood cells that the user can play around with. There'll be a ripple effect on the screen every time the user clicks something and I'll try to make it as PG and not as vivid as possible. Maybe animation on how the blood cell behaves because of a specific disease and why it could be fatal. 

When writing this, I don't think I manage my time well as I could've done it over the weekend; procrastination. I'll have to work on motivating myself into doing things that I'm supposed to do. Even when deciding on a topic, I was undecisive (probably because I'll have to stick with the topic for the rest of the year) and waiting for the time when my brain starts pumping out ideas. 

Overall, I'll need to research more blood diseases and decide on how to format it into a website. I also need to work on not being lazy.
